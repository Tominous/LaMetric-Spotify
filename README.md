This is a Spotify app for the La Metric clock. You'll have to set it up on your own server and with your own private app because it's resource intensive when public and is also rate limited. See [this discussion](https://help.lametric.com/support/discussions/topics/6000046483) for more info on that.

Here is a screenshot of the app's settings page, which you should match, or change to your liking:
